This project is undertaken to setup a simple but efficient Paperless Timesheet Management System (PTMS) for students and staff working in schools and universities. The project will implement advanced features in Core Java programming language such as Servlets, JSP's and Struts with the help of powerful development environment tools such as Eclipse and the App Server provided from the Google's App Engine (GAE) service. The PTMS system will allow the user to easily manage employee timesheets, approve employee timesheets, and calculate their payrolls. This project aims to deliver a simple, cost-effective, and user-friendly tool within 7 weeks.
